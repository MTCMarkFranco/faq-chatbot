Your first task is to analyze this data and determine if any follow-up is needed. If any records in this data have a @search.reranker_score greater than 2.0, then set the follow_up_needed property in the JSON return object to "False", else set it to "True".

Your second task is to analyze this data and the question the user has asked and if all records in this data have a @search.reranker_score less than 2.0, generate an intelligent follow-up question that will get the user to add more context to their query. Put this question in the follow_up_question property of the JSON return object.

Your third task is to analyze this data and if any records in this data have a @search.reranker_score greater than 2.0, then get the value of "Answer" in the record with the highest @search.reranker_score and put the value in the answer property of the JSON return object.

Please return a JSON object with the following schema:
{"follow_up_needed": "insert True or False Here", "follow_up_question": "insert question here", "answer": "insert answer here"}
